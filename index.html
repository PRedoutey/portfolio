										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>My first exposure to programming was in high school, where I helped manage the school website. It sparked my interest in programming, which led me to pursue it at Shawnee State University, where I completed my Bachelors in Digital Simulation & Gaming with a minor in Computer Engineering Technology. I maintained a 4.0 GPA while also being a member of Shawnee State's esports team.</p>
										<p>I am currently working as an intern at <a href="https://yostlabs.com/">Yost Labs, Inc.</a> in Portsmouth, OH.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Trials of Olympus</h3>
											<p>Trials of Olympus was a game created in Unreal Engine by a group of about 20 programming and art students for our senior project at Shawnee State.</p>
											<p>My main role in the project was to code the enemies, whether it was their pathfinding, attacks, or decision making.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Escape from the Labyrinth</h3>
											<p>Escape from the Labyrinth was  the first game I created. I made it in pygame toward the end of my first year of college. The goal is to use pressure plates, levers, and portals to reach the end of the levels.</p>
											<p>It was originally a group project, but my partner dropped the class after we finished planning the features of the game. Even with the additional work, I was happy at how it turned out.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Graph Visualization</h3>
											<p>This project is from an assignment in my second year of college. It can be used to visualize a graph of nodes. In this case, it shows some of the major roads around the Portsmouth area.</p>
											<p>The data is stored using a custom graph I created in C++ and is visualized using the SFML library.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Pathfinding Visualization</h3>
											<p>Programmed in pygame, this project provides an animated visual representation of Dijkstra's Algorithm and the A* Search Algorithm. The above image is an example of using A* Search to find the shortest path between Arad and Bucharest.</p>
